I want to enhance the Polish Warhammer Fantasy Tavern system with advanced interactive features. Please implement the following specific improvements:

**Primary Enhancement Request:**
Add an innovative drag-and-drop interface system with the following components:

1. **Dynamic Participant Management:**
   - Create a drag-and-drop interface that allows users to dynamically add or remove AI characters from active conversations
   - Implement visual character cards that can be dragged into/out of an "Active Conversation" zone
   - Show real-time participant count and update conversation dynamics based on active participants
   - Ensure all interactions remain in Polish language

2. **Configurable Response Timing:**
   - Replace the fixed 45-second AI response interval with an adjustable slider control
   - Implement a range slider (e.g., 15-120 seconds) with Polish labels
   - Allow real-time adjustment of conversation pace without restarting the application
   - Display current timing setting in Polish (e.g., "Częstotliwość odpowiedzi: 45 sekund")

3. **Enhanced Functionality Features:**
   - Add conversation history panel that can be toggled on/off
   - Implement character mood indicators that affect their speaking style
   - Create conversation themes/topics that users can select to influence AI responses
   - Add sound effects and ambient tavern sounds with volume controls

**Technical Requirements:**
- Maintain full Polish language support throughout all new features
- Ensure the drag-and-drop interface is touch-friendly for mobile devices
- Keep the medieval Warhammer Fantasy aesthetic in all UI elements
- Preserve existing character personalities and speaking patterns

**Context Integration:**
Since we have the ar-experience.ts file open and have been working on Phase 6 Digital Enlightenment, please clarify if you want these enhancements:
- Integrated into the current Phase 6 system as an AR tavern experience
- Developed as a standalone enhanced Warhammer Fantasy Tavern application
- Combined with AR capabilities for an immersive 3D tavern environment

Please implement these features with focus on user experience and Polish language authenticity.
